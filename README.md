# BatemanBot
A simple discord bot which sent random Patrick Bateman quotes that I extended to play music in voice channels though the [Wavelink.py](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink) Library


Requires [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink), which is the server program that streams music from YouTube to the Discord bot. Check out [Wavelink's server instalation guide to get started](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink#lavalink-installation)
